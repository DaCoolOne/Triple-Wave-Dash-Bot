# How to Try It Out

Special thanks to our sponsers (not really) over at RLBot! If you want to try this out, you must first download RLBot from their official website, rlbot.org.

Here's a tutorial on how to set that up:

Once that's done, simply download this repo and tell RLBot to load it as a bot (using the big plus button, you can't miss it). Feel free to try changing the code for yourself!
